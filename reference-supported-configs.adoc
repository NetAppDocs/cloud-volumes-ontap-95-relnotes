[.lead]
Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in AWS and Azure in two pricing options: pay-as-you-go and Bring Your Own License (BYOL). For pay-as-you-go, you can choose from three configurations: Explore, Standard, or Premium.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP for AWS

In AWS, you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single node system or as an HA pair.

| Underlying storage 4+| General Purpose SSDs (gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSDs (io1), and Throughput Optimized HDDs (st1), up to 16 TiB per disk

| Maximum system capacity
(disks + object storage) | 2 TiB | 10 TiB | 368 TiB | 368 TiB per license

Notes:

. The instance types denoted with a * include local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. Compression must be disabled on all volumes to take advantage of the Flash Cache performance improvements. link:reference-limitations.html#flash-cache-limitations[Learn more].

. For some configurations, disk limits prevent you from reaching the 368 TiB capacity limit by using disks alone. In those cases, you can reach the 368 TiB capacity limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_data_tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^]. For information about disk limits, refer to link:reference-storage-limits.html[storage limits].

. If you enable data tiering, a system’s capacity limit stays the same. The capacity limit includes both disks and object storage.

. Data tiering is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP Standard, Premium, and BYOL.

. When you choose an EC2 instance type, you can specify whether it is a shared instance or a dedicated instance.

. Cold HDDs are not supported with HA pairs.

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using EBS SSDs with Cloud Volumes ONTAP Standard, Premium, and BYOL.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure

In Azure, you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single node system or as an HA pair.

=== Single node systems

You can choose from the following configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single-node system in Azure:

| Underlying storage 4+| Standard HDD Managed Disks, Standard SSD Managed Disks, and Premium SSD Managed Disks, up to 32 TiB per disk

| Maximum system capacity
(disks + object storage) | 2 TiB | 10 TiB | 368 TiB | 368 TiB per license

Notes:

. If you enable data tiering, a system’s capacity limit stays the same. The capacity limit includes both disks and object storage.

. Data tiering is not supported with the DS3_v2 virtual machine type.

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using Azure Premium Storage disks, but not when using the DS3_v2 virtual machine type.

. For Azure region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].
